# Three Phase Transmission Line Fault Detection and Protection 
Model of typical overhead Three-Phase Electrical Transmission Lines created on SimuLink, for generation of dataset which is used to predict both Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Shunt Faults using Machine Learning algorithms. Protection Systems using control relays has also been proposed as part of this project.
